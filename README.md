# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). To run the app in development mode, you can run ### `npm start` or Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


# Virtual Bookshelf Front End

This is the front end of the Virtual Bookshelf web app. When run in tandem with the Virtual Bookshelf Back End, it allows avid bookreaders to search for books, add books to their bookshelf, as well as view recommended books for their next reads by using data from the Google Books API. In additon to viewing books, it allows users to leave ratings and comments on their books to help other users determine their next reads as well. 

This app was created to make lives easier for many that read both virtual books and physical copies of books by allowing the user to have one space to save all of their reads and track the books they have read, instead of using multiple platforms for ebooks and physical copies, or even making a list in the notes section of their phone (guilty!). 

The technologies used in the front end of this application include:
- React.js
- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML
- Material UI (Thumbs Up & Thumbs Down Icons)
- Axios
- Google Books API.
